Absolutely Daksh ‚Äî let‚Äôs break this down line-by-line and then dry-run it with a sample tree. This code solves **LeetCode 987: Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree**, and it‚Äôs a beautiful mix of BFS + coordinate mapping + sorting.

---

## üîç Line-by-Line Explanation

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> verticalTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
```
- This is the function signature. You‚Äôre given the root of a binary tree and need to return a list of vertical slices (columns), each as a vector of integers.

---

```cpp
map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> colMap;
```
- `colMap[col] = vector of (row, val)` pairs.
- This groups nodes by their **column index** (`col`) and stores their **row** and **value**.
- `map` keeps columns sorted from left to right.

---

```cpp
queue<tuple<TreeNode*, int, int>> q; // node, row, col
q.push({root, 0, 0});
```
- BFS queue storing `(node, row, col)` for each node.
- Root starts at position `(0, 0)`.

---

```cpp
while (!q.empty()) {
```
- Standard BFS loop ‚Äî level-by-level traversal.

---

```cpp
    auto [node, row, col] = q.front(); q.pop();
```
- Extract the current node and its position.

---

```cpp
    colMap[col].push_back({row, node->val});
```
- Store the node‚Äôs value and row in the map under its column.

---

```cpp
    if (node->left) q.push({node->left, row + 1, col - 1});
    if (node->right) q.push({node->right, row + 1, col + 1});
```
- Left child goes to next row and one column left.
- Right child goes to next row and one column right.

---

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> result;
```
- Final answer container.

---

```cpp
for (auto& [col, nodes] : colMap) {
```
- Iterate over each column in sorted order.

---

```cpp
    sort(nodes.begin(), nodes.end()); // sort by row, then val
```
- Sort nodes in this column:
  - First by row (top to bottom)
  - Then by value (if same row)

---

```cpp
    vector<int> colVals;
    for (auto& [row, val] : nodes) colVals.push_back(val);
    result.push_back(colVals);
```
- Extract just the values (discard row info) and push to result.

---

```cpp
return result;
```
- Done!

## üß™ Dry Run Example

Input: `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`

Tree:
```
        3
       / \
      9  20
         / \
        15  7
```

### BFS Traversal with Coordinates

| Node | Row | Col | Action |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| 3    | 0   | 0   | colMap[0] ‚Üê (0,3) |
| 9    | 1   | -1  | colMap[-1] ‚Üê (1,9) |
| 20   | 1   | 1   | colMap[1] ‚Üê (1,20) |
| 15   | 2   | 0   | colMap[0] ‚Üê (2,15) |
| 7    | 2   | 2   | colMap[2] ‚Üê (2,7) |

### colMap after BFS

```cpp
{
  -1: [(1,9)],
   0: [(0,3), (2,15)],
   1: [(1,20)],
   2: [(2,7)]
}
```

### After Sorting and Extraction

```cpp
result = [
  [9],        // col -1
  [3, 15],    // col 0
  [20],       // col 1
  [7]         // col 2
]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Output

```cpp
[[9], [3,15], [20], [7]]
```
