To solve the **Left View of a Binary Tree**, you want to capture the **first node at each level** when the tree is viewed from the left side. There are two popular ways to do this: **Level Order (BFS)** and **Depth First Search (DFS)**. Let’s break both down simply.

---

## ✅ 1. BFS Approach (Using Queue)

### 💡 Idea:
- Traverse level by level using a queue.
- For each level, the **first node you dequeue** is the leftmost node — add it to the result.

### 🧱 Steps:
1. Initialize a queue with the root.
2. While queue is not empty:
   - Get the size of the current level.
   - For each node in this level:
     - If it's the **first node**, add it to the result.
     - Push its left and right children into the queue.

### 🧑‍💻 Code Sketch (C++):
```cpp
vector<int> leftView(Node* root) {
    vector<int> view;
    if (!root) return view;

    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelSize = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
            Node* curr = q.front(); q.pop();
            if (i == 0) view.push_back(curr->data); // first node of level
            if (curr->left) q.push(curr->left);
            if (curr->right) q.push(curr->right);
        }
    }
    return view;
}
```

## ✅ 2. DFS Approach (Recursive)

### 💡 Idea:
- Traverse the tree in **preorder** (root-left-right).
- Keep track of the **maximum level visited so far**.
- If current level is greater than max level, it means this is the first node at this level — add it.

### 🧱 Steps:
1. Start from root at level 0.
2. Recursively go left first, then right.
3. Track max level reached so far.

### 🧑‍💻 Code Sketch (C++):
```cpp
void dfs(Node* root, int level, int& maxLevel, vector<int>& view) {
    if (!root) return;
    if (level > maxLevel) {
        view.push_back(root->data);
        maxLevel = level;
    }
    dfs(root->left, level + 1, maxLevel, view);
    dfs(root->right, level + 1, maxLevel, view);
}

vector<int> leftView(Node* root) {
    vector<int> view;
    int maxLevel = -1;
    dfs(root, 0, maxLevel, view);
    return view;
}
```

## 🧠 Which one to use?
- **BFS** is easier to understand and implement.
- **DFS** is elegant and uses recursion — good for interviews.

You can see the full problem and examples on [GeeksforGeeks Left View Practice Page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/left-view-of-binary-tree/1).

Want me to dry-run this on a sample tree so you can see how nodes are picked?



Great question — and the answer is **no**, this code is **not using preorder traversal**.

---

## 🔍 What this code is doing:
It’s performing a **Level Order Traversal (BFS)** using a `queue`.  
- It visits nodes **level by level**, from top to bottom.  
- At each level, it picks the **first node** (i.e., the leftmost node) and adds it to the `view`.

## 🔁 Preorder vs Level Order — Quick Comparison

| Traversal Type     | Order of Visiting Nodes                  | Used in Your Code? |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Preorder (DFS)** | Root → Left → Right                       | ❌ No               |
| **Level Order (BFS)** | Level by Level, Left to Right within each level | ✅ Yes              |

In your code:
- You use a `queue` → that’s a classic BFS tool.
- You loop through each level (`levelSize`) and pick the first node (`i == 0`) → that’s how you get the left view.

---
Great — let’s settle this like pros. You’re asking: **DFS vs BFS — which is better for Left View of Binary Tree?**  
The answer depends on what you care about: **simplicity, performance, or flexibility**. Let’s break it down.

## 🧠 BFS (Level Order Traversal) — Most Common & Practical

### ✅ Pros:
- **Straightforward logic**: Use a queue, visit level by level.
- **Naturally fits the problem**: Left view = first node at each level → BFS gives you that directly.
- **Easy to debug**: You can see each level clearly.

### ❌ Cons:
- Needs a queue → uses **O(w)** space (w = max width of tree).

---

## 🧠 DFS (Preorder with Level Tracking) — Elegant & Recursive

### ✅ Pros:
- **No extra data structures**: Just recursion and a level counter.
- **Elegant for interviews**: Shows depth understanding.
- **Can be extended**: Easily adapted for right view, top view, etc.

### ❌ Cons:
- Slightly tricky to implement correctly.
- Uses **O(h)** space (h = height of tree) due to recursion stack.

## ⚔️ Real-Life Comparison

| Feature               | BFS (Queue)         | DFS (Recursion)      |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Simplicity            | ✅ Easy              | ⚠️ Slightly tricky     |
| Space Complexity      | O(w)                | O(h)                  |
| Performance           | O(n)                | O(n)                  |
| Interview Friendly    | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                 |
| Extendability         | Moderate            | High (can tweak easily)

---

## 🏁 Verdict:
- **Use BFS** if you want quick, clean, and readable code.
- **Use DFS** if you want recursion practice or need to extend logic later.

Both are correct. Just pick the one that fits your style or the constraints of the problem.

Want me to show both versions side-by-side on the same tree so you can see how they behave?
