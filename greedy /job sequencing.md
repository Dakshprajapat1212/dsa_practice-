Hereâ€™s the classic greedy approach we likely used last time for the **Job Sequencing Problem**. It involves sorting jobs by profit and scheduling them in the latest available slot before their deadline:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> jobSequencing(vector<int>& deadline, vector<int>& profit) {
        int n = deadline.size();
        vector<pair<int, int>> jobs;

        // Pair each job's profit with its deadline
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            jobs.push_back({profit[i], deadline[i]});
        }

        // Sort jobs in descending order of profit
        sort(jobs.rbegin(), jobs.rend());

        // Find the maximum deadline to size the time slots
        int maxDeadline = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            maxDeadline = max(maxDeadline, jobs[i].second);
        }

        // Track occupied time slots
        vector<bool> slot(maxDeadline + 1, false);

        int countJobs = 0, totalProfit = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Try to schedule job in the latest possible slot before its deadline
            for (int j = jobs[i].second; j > 0; --j) {
                if (!slot[j]) {
                    slot[j] = true;
                    countJobs++;
                    totalProfit += jobs[i].first;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return {countJobs, totalProfit};
    }
};
```

ðŸ§  **Key Idea**: Maximize profit by scheduling the most profitable jobs as late as possible before their deadlines.
Absolutely! Let's break down the **Job Sequencing Problem** step by stepâ€”starting with the intuition, then a dry run, and finally why this greedy approach works so well.

### ðŸ§  Intuition Behind the Greedy Approach

Youâ€™re given jobs with:
- A **deadline** (latest time by which it must be completed)
- A **profit** (earned only if completed by its deadline)

Each job takes **1 unit of time**, and only **one job can be done at a time**.

So, the goal is:
- Maximize the **number of jobs** done within their deadlines
- Maximize the **total profit**

**Greedy Strategy**:
- Prioritize jobs with **higher profit** first.
- Try to schedule each job in the **latest available slot** before its deadline.
- This ensures that:
  - High-profit jobs are not wasted
  - Earlier slots are preserved for jobs with tighter deadlines

---

### ðŸ§ª Dry Run Example

Letâ€™s take this input:

```cpp
deadline[] = [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]
profit[]   = [100, 19, 27, 25, 15]
```

Step 1: Pair and sort jobs by profit (descending):

| Job | Deadline | Profit |
|-----|----------|--------|
| 1   | 2        | 100    |
| 3   | 2        | 27     |
| 4   | 1        | 25     |
| 2   | 1        | 19     |
| 5   | 1        | 15     |

Step 2: Initialize time slots: `slot[1..2] = [false, false]`

Step 3: Try to place each job in the latest available slot â‰¤ deadline:

- Job 1 (deadline 2): slot 2 is free â†’ place it â†’ profit = 100
- Job 3 (deadline 2): slot 1 is free â†’ place it â†’ profit = 100 + 27 = 127
- Job 4 (deadline 1): slot 1 is taken â†’ skip
- Job 2 (deadline 1): slot 1 is taken â†’ skip
- Job 5 (deadline 1): slot 1 is taken â†’ skip

âœ… Final result: `2 jobs`, `total profit = 127`

---

### âœ… Why This Works

- **Sorting by profit** ensures we never miss out on high-value jobs.
- **Latest slot allocation** helps fit more jobs by not crowding early slots.
- Itâ€™s efficient: runs in roughly **O(n log n)** due to sorting, and **O(n Ã— d)** for slot allocation (can be optimized with DSU).

Would you like me to show how this could be optimized further using Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for faster slot allocation? Or maybe visualize this with a timeline?
