There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).  Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].  Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.  You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.     Example 1:  Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0 Output: true Example 2:  Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3 Output: false    Constraints:  1 <= nums.length <= 5000 -104 <= nums[i] <= 104 nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot. -104 <= target <= 104    Follow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates.

You're asking about the "Search in Rotated Sorted Array II" problem, which deals with searching for an integer in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates. The optimal approach to solve this problem is an adaptation of the classic binary search algorithm.

Here's a brief explanation:

Since the array is rotated, a simple binary search won’t directly work. Instead, we use a modified binary search.

If nums[mid] equals target, return true.

If nums[left] equals nums[mid], then we can't determine which side is sorted, so we increment left by one.

Otherwise, determine which side is properly sorted:

If the left side is sorted (nums[left] <= nums[mid]), check if target lies within this range. If yes, move right to mid - 1; otherwise, move left to mid + 1.

If the right side is sorted (nums[mid] <= nums[right]), check similarly and adjust the search boundaries.

If target is found, return true; otherwise, return false.

Regarding runtime complexity:
Without duplicates, binary search would run in O(log n) time.

With duplicates, in the worst case (e.g., if many values are the same as mid), we may end up doing a linear scan, reducing efficiency to O(n) in the worst case.

Would you like a coded implementation for this approach?

what is rotated array
Copilot said
A rotated array is an array that was originally sorted in ascending order but has been shifted, or rotated, at some unknown pivot point. This means that part of the array has been moved to the front while the remaining portion has been shifted to the back.

For example, consider the sorted array: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] If rotated at index 4, the new array becomes: [5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 4]

Even though the original order is disrupted, the numbers still follow a non-decreasing sequence in two segments.

Rotated arrays commonly appear in algorithm problems, especially in binary search challenges, since they require modified search techniques to efficiently locate elements.
