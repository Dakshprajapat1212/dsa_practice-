Great question! Maintaining both the regular stack and the min stack during a `pop()` operation is the key to keeping the minimum retrieval in constant time. Here's how it works:

### ðŸ§  Two-Stack Strategy Recap
- **Main Stack**: Stores all the values you push.
- **Min Stack**: Stores the minimum value at each level of the main stack.

### ðŸ”„ Pop Operation Logic
When you call `pop()`:
- You remove the top element from the **main stack**.
- You also remove the top element from the **min stack** â€” because it corresponds to the minimum value **at that level** of the main stack.

### ðŸ’¡ Example Walkthrough
Letâ€™s say you push these values in order: `push(5)`, `push(3)`, `push(7)`

| Operation | Main Stack | Min Stack |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| push(5)   | [5]        | [5]       |
| push(3)   | [5, 3]     | [5, 3]    |
| push(7)   | [5, 3, 7]  | [5, 3, 3] |

Now, if you `pop()`:
- Main Stack becomes `[5, 3]`
- Min Stack becomes `[5, 3]`

So `getMin()` still returns `3`, which is correct.

### âœ… Why This Works
Each time you push a value, you compare it with the current min:
```python
min_stack.append(min(val, min_stack[-1]))
```
And when you pop, you remove from both stacks:
```python
main_stack.pop()
min_stack.pop()
```

Would you like to see a full Python implementation or try a custom test case together?


Your implementation is already solid and meets the problemâ€™s requirement of **O(1)** time for all operations. But if you're looking for **space optimization**, thereâ€™s a clever tweak you can apply.

### ðŸš€ Current Space Usage
Your `mins` stack duplicates the top value even when the minimum doesnâ€™t change. That means for every push, you're storing an extra value in `mins`, even if it's the same as before.

### âœ… Optimized Version: Only Push New Min
Instead of pushing the current min every time, only push to `mins` when the new value is **less than or equal** to the current min. When popping, only pop from `mins` if the popped value equals the top of `mins`.

Hereâ€™s how it looks:

```cpp
class MinStack {
private:
    stack<int> st;
    stack<int> mins;

public:
    MinStack() {}

    void push(int val) {
        st.push(val);
        if (mins.empty() || val <= mins.top()) {
            mins.push(val);
        }
    }

    void pop() {
        if (st.top() == mins.top()) {
            mins.pop();
        }
        st.pop();
    }

    int top() {
        return st.top();
    }

    int getMin() {
        return mins.top();
    }
};
```

### ðŸ§  Why This Is Better
- **Space-efficient**: `mins` only stores values when the minimum actually changes.
- **Still O(1)** for all operations.
- **Cleaner logic**: avoids redundant pushes.
